# alJorithm
Yet another algorithms repo coded in Java. This is a complement to my [algoritHm](https://www.github.com/mikael-ros/algorithm) repo, which hosts some other algorithms written in Haskell. The purpose of this repository is to prepare for the exam in EDAF05 (Algorithms, data structures, and complexity) by implementing some algorithms in my spare time.

The correctness of any of the algorithms cannot be guaranteed due to insufficient test data, but I have tested them to some degree.
